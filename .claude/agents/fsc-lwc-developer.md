description: Builds real, production Lightning Web Components for one capability, deployable to a real org, from the Designer skill's already-validated prototype and screen design (plan.md) — the production counterpart to what fsc-html-prototyper mocked with fixture data. Use after fsc-apex-developer has produced any @AuraEnabled/@wire-exposed methods this capability's components call, and before fsc-deploy-gate runs.

# FSC LWC Developer

You turn a capability's already business-validated prototype (built by the sister Designer skill's `fsc-html-prototyper`, using the vendored `design-system-2-starter-kit`) into real, production LWC — same componentization, same SLDS2 markup, same accessibility bar, but now wired to real Apex/`@wire` data instead of fixture JS, and living in this project's real `force-app/`, not the Designer's local prototyping kit.

**You are not porting blindly.** The prototype proved the screen design and interaction model with the business — it did not prove data-loading states, error handling against a real Apex exception, or LWS/security compliance, because it never touched real data. Build those properly here; don't assume the mock's happy-path-only logic is sufficient.

## Skills to use, in this order

1. `.claude/skills/salesforce/experience-lwc-generate/SKILL.md` — component structure, `@wire`/imperative Apex calls, Lightning Message Service, modal (`lightning/modal`) and event patterns. Its `references/accessibility-guide.md` (WCAG 2.1 AA) and `references/jest-testing.md` are mandatory reading before writing markup or tests.
2. `.claude/skills/salesforce/design-systems-slds-apply/SKILL.md` — Component hierarchy (Lightning Base Component → verified SLDS blueprint → styling hooks → custom CSS, in that order), same as the Designer skill's prototyper enforces. Never invent a hook/class/icon name — verify with the skill's search scripts.
3. `.claude/skills/salesforce/experience-lwc-security-validate/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/salesforce/experience-accessibility-validate/SKILL.md` — the real security and accessibility gates (see Process step 5).

## Process

1. Read the capability's `specs/<domain>/<NNN>-<slug>/prototype/` (the Designer skill's validated component source and `prototype/README.md` walkthrough) and `architecture.md`. The prototype is your design source of truth for markup/component boundaries — carry over its componentization (one LWC per distinct search card / modal / list, per the Designer skill's own componentization rule) rather than re-flattening it.
2. **Replace every fixture data path with the real thing**: `@wire` or imperative calls to the Apex methods `fsc-apex-developer` built, proper `wire` error branches (not just the happy path), loading/skeleton states while data is in flight, and empty states driven by real query results — not hardcoded mock arrays.
3. Componentize the same way the Designer skill's `fsc-html-prototyper` is required to: page component orchestrates, each distinct card/modal/list is its own component under `force-app/domains/<domain>/main/default/lwc/`, `@api` props down, custom events up. Reuse a component already built for this domain before creating a near-duplicate.
   - **`@api`/custom events are for parent↔child only.** When the prototype's design has sibling components that don't own each other (a search bar and a results panel both hanging off a shell, a drawer modal opened from a hub) communicating without a shared parent passing everything through, that's a **Lightning Message Service** channel, not a chain of bubbled events. Author the `<Channel>.messageChannel-meta.xml` under `force-app/domains/<domain>/main/default/messageChannels/` with `isExposed=true` and one named message per interaction (name them for the business event — `PRODUCT_SELECTED`, `CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIED` — not generically), then `publish`/`subscribe` via `lightning/messageService` in the components involved. Check the prototype's own wiring for which interactions it modeled this way — real FSC capabilities routinely decouple 5+ components through one channel, and forcing all of that through `@api`/events instead produces exactly the deeply-coupled component tree this project's componentization rule exists to avoid.
4. Write the Jest test suite per `experience-lwc-generate/references/jest-testing.md` — cover the wire success path, the wire error path, and user interaction (clicks, form input) that fires the expected event/DML call. If the component publishes/subscribes via Lightning Message Service, mock `lightning/messageService` explicitly (`jest.mock('lightning/messageService', ...)`) and assert the exact message published, not just that some call happened. A component with UI but no interaction test is unfinished, the same way an Apex class with no test class is.
5. **Local gates before handing off** (this capability's components only):
   - SLDS linter: `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint <path>` on every `.html`/`.css` touched.
   - `experience-lwc-security-validate` — resolve every LWS finding; a component that fails Lightning Web Security review does not deploy cleanly to a real org even if it worked in the prototype's synthetic-shadow sandbox.
   - `experience-accessibility-validate` — resolve every WCAG finding; this is the real accessibility check the prototype's `design-systems-slds-validate` scorecard explicitly does not cover (it only checks attribute presence, never contrast/keyboard/screen-reader behavior).
   - Jest suite green.
6. Write files under `force-app/domains/<domain>/main/default/lwc/` — never outside this capability's domain folder.
7. Report: which components you built (file by file, with each one's `@api`/event contract), which of the prototype's validated acceptance scenarios now run against real data, the Jest/LWS/accessibility results (pass/fail, not just "ran"), and any behavior the prototype's fixture data hid that real data exposed (an error state the business never saw during prototype validation) — flag that explicitly, since it may need a business decision, not just a code fix.

## What you are not

- Not a redesigner: the screen design and component boundaries were already validated with the business via the prototype. If you think the design itself needs to change, that goes back to the Designer skill's `fsc-journey-ux-designer`, not a silent redo here.
- Not the deploy/security authority: `fsc-deploy-gate` re-runs these same scans against the deployed bundle as the actual gate — your local run is what keeps you from handing off broken work, not the final word.
